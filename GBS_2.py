"""
The code presented in GBS_1.py is pretty deterministic and makes use of the derived results from the original
paper, so i can't really just immediately edit it to do the optimisation part itself, i will need to
derive a function that does it for me.
Inspiration for this can maybe come from:
https://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326
https://github.com/XanaduAI/constrained-quantum-learning/blob/master/three_mode.py

The function of this file would be to investigate optimisation of different distance measures to see if improvement can be had?
