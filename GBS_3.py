"""
This code centres on implementing the Bayesian test for GBS_1.py.
The Bayesian test is outlined in:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10058.pdf

So the approach is to take GBS_1.py and basically turn it into one big function that generates the clicks and stores the results
and then compare it to data from the ground truth and run the Bayesian test that way.
